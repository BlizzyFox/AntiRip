### Has this been bypassed?

No.

### Does AntiRip support Quest?

No, Quest only allows whitelisted shaders. This project uses a custom shader. Due to this, it will not function.

### How do I protect a quest version of my avatar?

<b>Don't upload an avatar to the quest platform that you don't want ripped.</b> We recommend that if you absolutely must have a quest version that you upload a pared down version or placeholder that you're okay with being exposed. *You should be doing this anyway for proper quest support. Uploading the pc version of an avatar with only the materials changed not only completely negates the purpose of adding anti-rip to an avatar but its bad for quest performance.*

### If I upload the PC version of an avatar with the anti rip + the quest version (no anti rip) will it effect syncing of its toggles?

Yes, In order for toggles to be synced they must have the same parameters. *You should not upload anything to the quest platform that you want protected. Uploading a barely changed version of your avatar to the quest platform negates the purpose of adding antirip.*

### I still want *something* for my quest avatar.

You can use [this obfuscator](https://github.com/Ess-Ka/EsskaAV3Obfuscator) on quest. <b> This wont stop your work from being stolen only make it slightly more annoying to do. </b>

### How do I protect my avatar's Textures?

See [this project](https://github.com/Shell4026/ShellProtector) for now.

### Does this affect performance? 

This creates no more polygons, makes only one layer and only adds 32 bits to parameters.

### I found my avatar on ripper store

Kanna Protecc cannot remove your avatar from ripperstore. Kanna Protecc prevents rippers from getting a usable version of your avatar. Rippers aren't honest and they may still upload the unusable copy of your avatar to ripperstore. 

### Can my avatar be hotswaped?

A typical hotswap will not bypass this. It would take a specialized one. Which would only get the avatar working normally in game; not in unity.

### Is there anything else I can do to protect my work?

Add a watermark! A quad hidden inside the torso of your avatar with a watermark will help drive hotswappers into being banned which they wont be able to remove, as the meshes will be encrypted, regardless of hotswap.
